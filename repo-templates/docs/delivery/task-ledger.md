# Task Ledger

> **Deprecated — legacy snapshot only.**
> Canonical task state is now managed through the task-ledger MCP server.
> This file is an optional human-readable export. Do not treat it as authoritative.
> See `docs/delivery/task-mcp-operating-model.md` and `skills/task-ledger-mcp/SKILL.md`.

This file was previously the Orchestrator's durable record of in-flight delegated work. It is retained as a deployment template for projects that use it as a human-readable snapshot.

## Operating Rules

- Each task entry must use a level-2 heading in the form `## Task <task-id> - <title>`.
- Each task entry must contain exactly one fenced `json` block.
- The JSON payload is the machine-updatable source of truth for task state.
- Human notes belong outside the JSON block only when they add context the payload does not carry.

## Required JSON Fields

- `task`
- `state`
- `current_action`
- `next_action`
- `history`

## Optional Operational Fields

- `owner` — the named agent currently accountable for the task
- `branch` — active implementation branch (set by Orchestrator when Builder starts)
- `pr` — GitHub PR number or URL (set when Builder raises the PR)
- `expected_callback_at` — ISO-8601 timestamp used by the OpenClaw watchdog cron to detect overdue callbacks

## Allowed States

- `queued`
- `in_progress`
- `blocked`
- `needs_review`
- `done`

## Entry Template

```
